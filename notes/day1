x86 assembly

started with the intel 8086
  - only did integer arithmetic 
  - later released 8087, which added floating point arithmetic
  - 80286, pentium, ... 

what is bss?


reserving float array 

in assembly
-------
segment .bss
myinfo resq 50

to c++
------
double myinfo[50];


segment .text
two_floats; // this is file name

back up register
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp


mov - copies data from one register to the other
ex) mov rbp, rsp


printf(form, message)
       rdi,  rsi


put next line into main function
float num = asmfunc()

make sure asmfunc is declared globally
