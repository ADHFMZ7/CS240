midterm on the 8th week
=================

Assignment 2:
  input two floats without validation
    -assume user gives valid input
  compute sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
  output hypotenuse
  will take multiple instructions

Two's complement (signed ints)

  "width" = how many bits 
    ex) c int = width 32 
  in twos complement, far left bit is "sign"
    ex) 11101: number is negative bc first bit is 1
    ex_ 01101: number is positive bc first bit is 0
  to
